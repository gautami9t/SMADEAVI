# Smart Mobile App Development for Efficient Assistance to the Visually Impaired

This project aims to build an Android app that will help visually impaired people to be more independent in their daily lives. The app will use machine learning (Speech Recognition and Object Detection) to enable visually impaired people to interact with their surroundings more easily.

Features
Object detection: The app will be able to detect objects in the user's surroundings and speak out their names. This will allow visually impaired people to identify objects around them, such as food, furniture, and other people.
Speech recognition: The app will also be able to recognize speech commands. This will allow visually impaired people to control the app using their voice. For example, they could say "What is this?" to have the app identify an object, or "Call an ambulance" to make an emergency call.
Other features: The app could also include other features, such as:
A calendar to help visually impaired people keep track of appointments and events.
A weather app to help them stay informed about the weather.
A map app to help them navigate their surroundings.

Libraries used:
Tensorflow

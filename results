YOLO is a fast object detection algorithm that can process images in real-time at 45 FPS.
YOLO has a lower false positive rate than Fast R-CNN, but it has more localization errors.
YOLO struggles with small objects because each cell grid is allowed to classify one object only.
YOLO V4 is the most accurate object detection algorithm, with an accuracy of 55.8%.
The Object Detection module of the project was successfully achieved.
The project fulfils the basic concepts of object detection and speech recognition.
A user friendly interface was developed on the Android app.
